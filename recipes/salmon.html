        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Salmon is a popular fish known for its rich, oily texture and distinctive pink-orange flesh. It is prized for its high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, which contribute to its health benefits. Salmon can be prepared in numerous ways, such as grilling, baking, or pan-searing, making it versatile for a wide range of culinary dishes from salads to main courses.</p>
